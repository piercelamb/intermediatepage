(this code depends on a local cassandra instance running and a local postgres instance running called "my-playful-prelaunch-development" I'm not sure if it will run otherwise)"

To run this code:

a.) If you have activator installed:

1.) git clone to the dir of your choice.
2.) navigate to that dir and type "activator run"
3.) open a browser and go to http://localhost:9000 (note this will begin the compilation process so could take a bit)
(I'm assuming sbt will download all the necessary dependencies, if it doesn't try "activator clean compile" then "activator run")

b.) If activator isnt installed:

1.) Download activator: https://typesafe.com/get-started
2.) add activator to your PATH: export PATH=$PATH:/relativePath/to/activator
3.) refer to a.)

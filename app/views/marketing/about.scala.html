            <p>We have spent the past decade building in-memory data products together.
                Our goal is to take the lessons we’ve learned in distributed data management
                and apply them to the rapidly expanding world of distributed data processing.
                We look for people that are motivated by challenges and want to work on
                the cutting edge of the big data industry.</p>
